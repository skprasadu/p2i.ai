## Summary
Building a curation workflow is less about “AI magic” and more about designing human checkpoints, state transitions, and repeatable outputs.

## Notes
- The workflow must support both AI-assisted and manual checkpoints.
- Outputs must be editable, versioned, and publishable.
- The UI must stay simple; complexity belongs in the pipeline.
